							<span class="image fit"><img src="images\WhatsApp Image 2023-05-02 at 11.12.42 AM.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I am Ashiq Rahman A, a driven and enthusiastic engineer specializing in the fields of mechanical and robotics engineering. Currently pursuing my Master's degree in Mechatronics and Robotics at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, I am dedicated to exploring the realms of mobile robotics, robotics engineering, and mechatronics engineering. Residing in Jersey City, New Jersey, United States, I am actively seeking summer 2023 internships to further enhance my skills and contribute to innovative automation and robotics solutions.</p>
							<p>One of my defining qualities is my passion for intuitive thinking and problem-solving. I am always motivated to tackle real-world challenges and find creative and practical solutions through the application of automation and robotics. Drawing on my industry experience, I have developed a strong foundation in designing and implementing automated systems. This experience has not only honed my technical skills but has also instilled in me the importance of effective communication and teamwork.</p>								
							<p>My ultimate goal is to make a positive impact on society through my work. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities that allow me to contribute to the betterment of our world. By leveraging my expertise in mechatronics and robotics engineering, I aspire to develop technologies that improve efficiency, enhance safety, and revolutionize various industries.</p>
							<p>During my tenure as the Treasurer of the Robotics Club at CEG, I gained invaluable experience in financial management. I oversaw the club's fundraising initiatives, collaborating with fellow members to plan and execute revenue-generating events. Additionally, I managed the club's budget, efficiently allocating funds to diverse projects and initiatives. Adept at banking and bookkeeping, I ensured accurate financial records and prepared reports that aided the club's leadership team in making informed decisions.</p>
							<p>As a Mechatronics Intern at Solinas Integrity Pvt. Ltd., I had the privilege of working on the groundbreaking Endobot 2.0 project. This advanced technology has the potential to transform pipeline inspection and maintenance. My primary responsibility involved developing and writing firmware code that controlled and regulated the robot's operations. With Endobot 2.0, pipelines could be inspected for damage, corrosion, and defects without the need for extensive downtime or revenue loss. By combining my coding expertise, mechatronics knowledge, and 3D printing skills, I contributed to the successful development of the robot.</p>
							<p>Another notable experience was serving as the Team Lead of the Intelligent Line Marking Bot project at CEG Tech Forum. In this role, I designed and implemented complex algorithms to ensure accurate localization and obstacle avoidance. Working with ROS on the RPi platform, I developed algorithms for path following under various conditions. By incorporating a 2D lidar system, the bot could make real-time adjustments to its path, achieving an impressive accuracy of 10 cm, surpassing the project's requirements.</p>
							<p>Complementing my practical experiences, my education has been instrumental in shaping my engineering expertise. I am currently pursuing a Master of Science (MS) in Mechatronics, Robotics, and Automation Engineering at New York University, with an expected completion date in May 2024. Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor of Engineering (BE) in Mechanical Engineering at the College of Engineering, Guindy in June 2022.</p>
							<p>In conclusion, I am an ambitious engineer with a strong background in mechanical and robotics engineering, fueled by a passion for intuitive thinking and problem-solving. Through my industry experience and educational pursuits, I have developed exceptional technical skills, communication abilities, and a collaborative mindset. My overarching aim is to leverage my expertise to positively impact society. If you are interested in learning more about my work or would like to connect with me, please feel free to reach out. Together, we can explore new frontiers in automation and robotics, and create a better future.</p>
