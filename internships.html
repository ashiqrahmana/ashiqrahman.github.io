							<h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/solinasin/?originalSubdomain=in">Mechatronics Intern - Solinas Integrity Pvt. Ltd.</a></h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1SMCC0eIQEw/mqdefault.jpg" alt="" /></span>During my tenure as a Mechatronics Intern at Solinas Integrity Pvt. Ltd., I played a crucial role in the research and development of an advanced inspection bot designed for operating inside industrial pipelines, with a remarkable reach of up to 250 meters.</p>
							<p>One of my key contributions was in the field of localization, where I implemented robust algorithms to precisely determine the bot's position within the pipeline. By integrating data from multiple sensors, I successfully mapped the intricate structure of the pipelines, providing valuable insights for inspection and maintenance purposes.</p>
							<p>My work required a deep understanding of mechatronic systems, including the integration of mechanical components, electronics, and software. I collaborated closely with a multidisciplinary team, contributing to the design, prototyping, and testing phases of the project.</p>
							<p>Throughout this experience, I developed strong problem-solving skills, as well as a keen eye for detail when it came to analyzing complex data sets and ensuring the accuracy of the mapping process. I effectively communicated my findings and progress to the team, fostering a collaborative environment and contributing to the overall success of the project.</p>
							<p>This internship allowed me to further refine my technical expertise in mechatronics and deepen my understanding of the practical applications of robotics in industrial settings. I am confident that the skills and knowledge gained from this experience will enable me to make significant contributions in the field of robotics and automation in my future endeavors.</p>

							<h3>Research Assistantship - AI4CE</h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1SMCC0eIQEw/mqdefault.jpg" alt="" /></span>        During my time as a research assistant at the AI4CE NYU Lab from 2023 to 2024, I played a key role in achieving the lab's goals. Here are the main things I did:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>I made a practical dataset for training a neural network, which helps accurately locate things in the global coordinate system.</li>
								<li>I took charge of putting together hardware and the trained model and policy.</li>
								<li>Successfully made sure the model could pick up and place objects, demonstrating feasibility of the model and zero-shot transfer of the policy in the real world.</li>
								<li>Being hands-on in integrating hardware and software showed the practical side of AI research.</li>
						    	</ul>
						    	<p>This experience gave me a wide range of skills and a deep understanding of using AI in research. These achievements highlight my ability to contribute effectively to AI, computer vision, and practical implementation projects. They serve as clear examples of my skills and dedication to advancing the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
