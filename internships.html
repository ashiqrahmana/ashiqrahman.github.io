							<h3>GSET - Research Assistantship - AI4CE</h3>
							<p>Currently, I am actively contributing to cutting-edge research endeavors. My primary responsibilities revolved around leveraging UR5, Tracer (AgileX), and Husky robots to advance various research projects. Here are some of the main things I did :</p>
							<ul>
							    <li>Engaged in hands-on research activities involving the operation and programming of UR5 and Husky robots.</li>
							    <li>Spearheaded the development of a versatile testing platform tailored to assess and validate a wide array of research projects and concepts.</li>
							    <li>Collaborated closely with Professor Chen Feng and fellow researchers to streamline experimental protocols and enhance research outcomes.</li>
							    <li>Contributed insights and expertise to discussions on refining methodologies and troubleshooting technical challenges.</li>
							    <li>Demonstrated adaptability and proficiency in navigating complex tasks within a dynamic research environment.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>My experience at the AI4CE NYU lab was instrumental in honing my technical skills and fostering a deeper understanding of robotics applications in academic research. It provided me with invaluable insights into interdisciplinary collaboration and the iterative nature of scientific inquiry, laying a solid foundation for my future endeavors in the field.</p>

							<h3>Research Assistantship - AI4CE</h3>
							<p>At the forefront of AI research at NYU's AI4CE Lab, I played a pivotal role in a project focused on object manipulation with robots. My contributions spanned the entire research pipeline, from data preparation to real-world implementation.</p>
							<ul>
							  <li><strong>Built the Foundation:</strong> I collected a practical dataset, the backbone for training a neural network that accurately locates objects in a global coordinate system.</li>
							  <li><strong>Bridged the Gap:</strong> I set the hardware for the integration of the trained model and policy with the hardware platform, bridging the gap between theory and practice.</li>
							  <li><strong>Achieved Real-World Success:</strong> Witnessing the model successfully pick and place objects in the real world validated our approach and showcased the policy's zero-shot transfer capabilities.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>This hands-on experience integrating hardware and software provided invaluable insight into the practical considerations of AI research. This project not only equipped me with a diverse skillset but also fostered a deep understanding of applying AI in real-world research. My achievements demonstrate my ability to contribute effectively across AI, computer vision, and practical implementation projects. They stand as a testament to my skills and dedication to advancing the field of artificial intelligence.</p>

							<h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/solinasin/?originalSubdomain=in">Mechatronics Intern - Solinas Integrity Pvt. Ltd.</a></h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1SMCC0eIQEw/mqdefault.jpg" alt="" /></span>During my internship at Solinas Integrity, I spearheaded the research and development of an advanced inspection bot, engineered to traverse up to 250 meters within industrial pipelines. My pivotal role involved:</p>
							<ul>
							  <li>Designing robust algorithms leveraging data from multiple sensors to achieve precise location tracking for the bot, revolutionizing pipeline inspection and maintenance.</li>
							  <li>Contributing to all phases of the project, from design and prototyping to rigorous testing, showcasing my expertise in mechatronics and collaborative teamwork.</li>
							  <li>Enhancing problem-solving skills and attention to detail through complex data analysis for accurate mapping, while maintaining transparent communication to foster team collaboration and project progression.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Solinas Integrity provided not only valuable learning experiences but also an opportunity to refine my mechatronics skills and witness real-world applications of robotics in industrial settings. I am confident that the skills and knowledge acquired during this internship position me to make meaningful contributions in the dynamic field of robotics and automation.</p>
