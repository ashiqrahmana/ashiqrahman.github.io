Ltd., I played a crucial role in the research and development of an advanced inspection bot designed for operating inside industrial pipelines, with a remarkable reach of up to 250 meters.

								One of my key contributions was in the field of localization, where I implemented robust algorithms to precisely determine the bot's position within the pipeline. By integrating data from multiple sensors, I successfully mapped the intricate structure of the pipelines, providing valuable insights for inspection and maintenance purposes.
								
								My work required a deep understanding of mechatronic systems, including the integration of mechanical components, electronics, and software. I collaborated closely with a multidisciplinary team, contributing to the design, prototyping, and testing phases of the project.
								
								Throughout this experience, I developed strong problem-solving skills, as well as a keen eye for detail when it came to analyzing complex data sets and ensuring the accuracy of the mapping process. I effectively communicated my findings and progress to the team, fostering a collaborative environment and contributing to the overall success of the project.
								
								This internship allowed me to further refine my technical expertise in mechatronics and deepen my understanding of the practical applications of robotics in industrial settings. I am confident that the skills and knowledge gained from this experience will enable me to make significant contributions in the field of robotics and automation in my future endeavors.</p>
