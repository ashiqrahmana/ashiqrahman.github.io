							<h3>Flexible gripper</h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images\gripper picture.jpeg" alt="" /></span>This project focuses on the development of a bio-inspired two-fingered gripper with a Fin Ray (fish fin) structure and grooves on the contact side. The gripper is composed of soft cross beams that were optimized using the finite element method. Three different geometries were considered: Even, Uneven, and Semi-filled configurations. The grippers were 3D printed using Polyurethane material. The gripper with uneven cross beams showed controlled displacement and had the ability to handle various geometries and materials within its gripper length and payload capacity. The project aims to enhance the compliance and dexterity of robotic manipulators, making them safer for interaction with humans. The gripper design was inspired by fish fins and the Fin Ray Effect was utilized to improve grasping ability. The experiment involved simulation analysis using Inventor 2021 and physical testing using an articulated robot. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the gripper in gripping different objects.</p>
